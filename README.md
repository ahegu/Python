# DATA 765
This class covers the exciting and cutting-edge techniques broadly associated with the new
field called computational social science. What comes to define computational social science (or CSS, for
short) changes by the day. It is, in part, the application of computationally intensive techniques (like
machine learning, text analysis, and social networks) to the application of “Big Data” and web data to
answer social science questions. This is distinguished from data science, its broader intellectual and
methodological forbearer, insofar as that data science can be (1) inductive by nature, lacking a research
question or hypothesis, and (2) can be applied to other areas that do not include social forms of data
(e.g., electrical engineering, physics, astronomy, etc.).
